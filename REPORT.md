# Project Report: Catalyze AI Assistant

This report summarizes the development work performed on the Catalyze AI Assistant project, covering key features, architectural decisions, and code quality improvements.

## 1. Catalyze AI Package (`packages/catalyze_ai`)

### 1.1. Package Skeleton and Core Models

An independent Dart package, `catalyze_ai`, was created to encapsulate the core AI logic and data models. This modular approach ensures reusability and clear separation of concerns. The following models were defined:

*   `User`: Represents user information.
*   `StudyPlan`: Defines a user's study goals, including total units, deadlines, and now includes `createdAt`, `rounds`, `dailyQuota`, `dynamicDeadline`, `isArchived`, and `schemaVersion` for enhanced functionality and migration support.
*   `StudyRecord`: Records individual study sessions.
*   `ReviewSchedule`: Manages spaced repetition review dates.
*   `Metrics`: Stores calculated performance metrics.

### 1.2. Algorithm Implementation

Several pure functions were implemented within `packages/catalyze_ai/lib/algorithms/` to provide the intelligent core of the application:

*   `dynamicQuotaAlgorithm`: Calculates a dynamic daily study quota and adjusts deadlines based on remaining units, days until deadline, recent pace, and achievement rate. The return type `DailyQuotaResult` was renamed to `QuotaResult` for clarity.
*   `recomputeDynamicQuota`: A wrapper that calculates the necessary inputs (remaining units, pace, achievement rate) from a `StudyPlan` and its `StudyRecord`s, then calls `dynamicQuotaAlgorithm`.
*   `generateReviewSchedules`: Generates spaced repetition review dates based on completion time and a quality rating.
*   `allocateRounds`: Distributes study days across multiple rounds within a study plan.

Each algorithm was accompanied by comprehensive unit tests (`packages/catalyze_ai/test/algorithms_test.dart`) to ensure correctness and robustness, covering various edge cases and scenarios.

### 1.3. Service Layer

An abstract `Repository` interface was defined (`packages/catalyze_ai/lib/services/repository.dart`) to decouple data access from business logic. A basic `InMemoryRepository` implementation was provided for testing and prototyping purposes. A `FirestoreRepository` stub was also created to outline future integration with Firebase Firestore.

## 2. Flutter Application (`flutter_app`)

### 2.1. Application Setup and Integration

A new Flutter application, `flutter_app`, was created as a subproject. It was configured to depend on the `catalyze_ai` package using a local path dependency, demonstrating a monorepo-like structure.

### 2.2. AI Service and UI

*   `AIService`: This service acts as an intermediary between the Flutter UI and the `catalyze_ai` package. It injects a `Repository` implementation (defaulting to `InMemoryRepository`) and provides a `fetchDailyTasks` method to retrieve daily study tasks.
*   `HomeScreen`: A simple Flutter UI was implemented to display the tasks fetched from the `AIService`, showing loading states and handling empty task lists.

### 2.3. Widget Testing

A widget test (`flutter_app/test/widget_test.dart`) was implemented to verify that the `HomeScreen` correctly displays tasks by injecting a seeded `InMemoryRepository` into the `AIService`, ensuring UI functionality without external dependencies.

## 3. CI/CD and Documentation

### 3.1. GitHub Actions CI Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) was configured to automate the build and test process for both `catalyze_ai` and `flutter_app` on `pull_request` and `push` events to the `main` branch. This ensures continuous integration and early detection of issues.

### 3.2. Migration Documentation

Comprehensive documentation was created to guide future schema migrations:

*   `infra/migrations/README.md`: Outlines general procedures for schema changes, backward compatibility guidelines, and a migration strategy utilizing a `schemaVersion` field in data models.
*   `docs/migration_examples.md`: Provides a concrete example of a v1 to v2 schema migration, including steps for data backup, model updates, migration logic implementation, and rollback procedures.

## 4. Schema Migration Implementation

Following the defined migration strategy, the `StudyPlan` model was updated to include `isArchived` (boolean) and `schemaVersion` (integer) fields. Corresponding migration logic was implemented within the `InMemoryRepository`'s `getStudyPlan` method, ensuring that older schema versions are automatically migrated to the latest version upon retrieval.

## 5. Code Quality and Analysis

Throughout the development process, `flutter analyze` was used to identify and resolve code quality issues, including:

*   **Type Errors**: Corrected mismatches in function signatures and data types.
*   **Undefined Methods/Getters**: Ensured all methods and properties were correctly defined and imported.
*   **`const` Correctness**: Applied `const` keywords where appropriate for performance optimization and immutability, and removed them where mutable state prevented their use.
*   **Unnecessary Imports**: Cleaned up redundant imports.

Regular analysis and iterative bug fixing ensured a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Conclusion

The project has established a solid foundation for an AI-powered study assistant, featuring a modular architecture, intelligent algorithms, a functional Flutter application, robust testing, and a clear strategy for future extensibility and data migration. The implemented features demonstrate the core capabilities of dynamic study planning and progress tracking.
